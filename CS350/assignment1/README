2. Project 1A (Reading & Writing character-by-character and line-by-line)

3. Instructions
	
	a. Open terminal, "cd" all the way until you are the same 
	directory with the file "character-by-character.c" or â"line-by-line.c"
	
	b. To compile, copy/paste: 
		g++ -Wall -Wextra character-by-character.c
		g++ -Wall -Wextra line-by-line.c
	
	c. To run, type:
		./a.out

4. PLEASE READ EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	The compiler has the following flags:
	
		-Wall: for any warnings
		-Wextra: extra warnings that aren't set in -Wall

	The combined.c has fairly good comments. 

	Avoided using gets() since it is dangerous when accessing
	the buffer and all so used an alternative of scanf(). Before 
	using scanf() their was some issues with fgets() that would 
	not recognize any files so switched to scanf().

	There is only one function and takes no arguments. 
	The main function will run, ask user for input file name, 
	output filename, provide errors if necessary, and copy from 
	input file to output file. The user will be given 2 options,
	1 for character-by-character and 2 for line-by-line. At the end
	the program will provide the time of execution and close. If the user
	fails to put 1 or 2, the program terminates.

	The input and output file names MUST be less than 100 characters
	since 100 is the allocated. If it is larger than 100, it will
	no re-allocate and give segment fault.

	For the line-by-line option, the lines MUST be less than
	80 characters long or will give segment fault. 

	To change the file width, go to line 23.

	To change the width of each line go to line 95 and 98. 

	You can also check to see if the code is doing correctly
	by outputting character by character or line by line by
	uncommenting line 78 and 100.

	You MUST include the extention of what type of document
	the output file will be or will give segment fault. It
	will create a file but will not continue reading lines
	and copy to output file.
