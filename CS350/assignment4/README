3. Instructions
	
	a. Open terminal, "cd" all the way until you are the same 
	directory with the file "MMwP.cpp"
	
	b. To compile, copy/paste: 
		make
	
	c. To run, type:
		./ and press tab for auto-complete

	d. To clean, type:
		make clean

4. The compiling has the following flags:

	-g: gdb error handling

	-Wall: gives warning

	-Wextra: extra warning not handled by -Wall

	All other flags are necessary for makefile
	
	The make file is reused from CS 240 with descriptions. 

	If a matrix is not valid, it will create the output file 
	with nothing written in it. 

	The MMwP.cpp has comments that explains what
	my code does fairly clearly.
