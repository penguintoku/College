HOW TO:

	1. Open terminal and go to the same dircetory as where
	this program is located.
	
	2. Once reaching the same directory, simply type "make"

	3. type "./" and press tab for auto-fill. Then type "in" and tab
	for auto-fill. Then type "out" and tab for auto fill.
	***THIS PROGRAM MUST HAVE THREE COMPONENTS TO RUN!!!***
		-You will need to exe file, input, and output files.
		-I have made it so that it will not run without all three.
		-The reason is for 4.6 of the assignment must have three prompts.
		It should look like: $ ./Submission.exe inputFile.txt output.txt

	4. When all done, type "make clean"

DETAIL:

	The algorithm I used in this program is binary search.
	I used binary search to find to two values that will 
	find 2 keys and equal to another key. 

	I have also used the sort function provided in the C++ libary.

	The worst case of this would be O(n^2 log n)
