PURPOSE:

	The purpose of this project is:
		1. To find out how different pricing models and different user strategies affect the aggregate power of a community.
		2. Try to find a balance between the models so that peak load is reduced.
		3. Explore what will bring to the power line in community where users have different pricing models.


PERCENT COMPLETE:

	* 80% of the overall has been completed


PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:

	* The Appliance code
	* The Min and Max of each day for Real Time Pricing


BUGS:

	* This program will use a lot of memory!


FILES:

	There is a total of 13 files for this project:

		README.txt, the current file you are reading that has all information
		
		Community.cpp, Displays the total price and energy with each hour of energy.
		Community.h, the header file for Community.cpp
		House.cpp, The individual house of community made.
		House.h, the header file for House.cpp
		Driver.cpp, the main function

		makefile, to compile the code

		config.txt, the file to change in order to get results
			~ Please Read Driver.cpp in order to see how to run.

		FP.csv, Fixed Price data
		rtp.csv, Real Time Pricing data
		illinoisTOU.csv, One of the Time Of Use file
		ontarioTOU.csv, One of the Time Of Use file

		20housedata.zip, zip that contains 20 different house data.

		One file is not accounted for which is the result of the runned program. Go to the Driver.cpp to change the preference file name.


SAMPLE OUTPUT:

	Tokumarus-MacBook-Pro:Code tyahashi$ ./lab 
	Number of Houses: 5
	Assigning 1.csv to 1 houses.
	Assigning 2.csv to 1 houses.
	Assigning 6.csv to 1 houses.
	Assigning 7.csv to 1 houses.
	Assigning 9.csv to 1 houses.
	All houses have been assigned energy data. 
	EnergyBool val set to 1.
	Assigning illinoisTOU.csv to 5 houses for 56 days.
	All houses have been assigned Price data. 
	PriceBool val set to 1.
	BatteryBool val set to 1.
	ApplianceBool val set to 1.


PRE-COMPILE:

	* You will need to unzip the 20housedata.zip to get the house 
	* After unzipping the file, you must move the house data (are #.csv) with the rest of the files (where Driver.cpp) is located.
	* Change the desired output file name from the Driver.cpp 
	* PLEASE READ THE NOTES ON DRIVER.CPP which tells you what each symbol indicates for the config.txt
	* Open config.txt to change the results you want.


SITUATION:
	
	* When inputting the file in config.txt, you don not need to do some options:
		~ If you are using rtp.csv, you do not need to input the number of day.
			(# of houses to assign) rtp.csv
		~ Anything besides rtp.csv, you must add the number of days to run
			- Since our house data only had 2 months (56 days) worth of data throughout all houses, do NOT exceeed 56 days!
				(# of houses to assign) (some csv) (# of days)
		~ Please have all symbols in the config.txt (!,@,#,$) so the program doesn't get confused.
		~ Please be aware that we have not completed the appliance side of the code so do not add any number after the # or before the $ sign.
		
		EXAMPLE:
			10
			1 1.csv
			1 2.csv
			1 6.csv
			1 7.csv
			1 9.csv
			1 10.csv
			1 11.csv
			1 12.csv
			1 16.csv
			1 17.csv
			!
			5 illinoisTOU.csv 56
			5 rtp.csv
			@
			5
			#
			$

			The following example says: 
				There is going to be 10 houses in the community
				1 house of 1.csv data (which is the house data)
				1 house of 2.csv data
				...
				1 house of 17.csv data
				!
				5 houses will be assigned to the data illinoisTOU.csv (Time of Use) pricing plan for 56 days
				5 houses will be assigned to the data rtp.csv (Real Time Pricing) pricing plan
				@
				5 houses will be using battery strategy
				#
				$



TO COMPILE:

	* Extract the directories
	* Go to the directory of this project
	* In terminal type: make


TO RUN:

	* In terminal type: ./lab
	*** TO CHANGE THE DATA YOU MUST CHANGE IT IN THE FILE config.txt ***
		~ You will NOT have to re-compile if you only change the data.


EXTRA CREDIT:

	* N/A
